# Transfer data from mobile to OCM

This repo contains a weird utility to transfer data (specifically: LN invoices) from your mobile phone to the One-Click Miner. It will allow you to:

- Share it with a Telegram Bot
- Send it to a random burner e-mail address

The LN invoice you send gets read by OCM through the HTTP long poll endpoints.
